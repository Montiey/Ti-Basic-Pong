# Ti-Basic-Pong
It's Pong! Except single player, and crappy.

-Logs highscores

-Optimized for mathprint-capable devices

-Optimized to clean up after itself!


====== INSTALLING ======

This program was made on a TI-84+ SE, so it should work on anything similar. The TI-83 family may experience problems, however (it's untested).
Simply get a Mini USB cable and the TI-Connect CE software (TI-84 and up) or a TI Graph-Link adapter and the TI-Connect software (TI-83).
Upload the program. If given the option, upload to RAM.


====== TROUBLESHOOTING =====

Because I couldn't care less about whether or not this manages to run on your calculator, I recomend that you check out the [TI-Basic Developement WIki](http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/) if you get errors while screwing around.

Also, note that the raw text (.txt) file may have encoding issues since the TI software seems to use a modified character set. If things look weird, use the .8xp file.
